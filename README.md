Project (so-called 'Homework') for the Databases class.
<br><br>
It's a <b>Flask Web Application</b> that allows the clients of a fictional Internet Café to create <b>accounts</b>, make <b>appointments</b>, leave <b>feedbacks</b> and see <b>statistics</b> about their time spent there through a simple but precise Bootstrap web page.
<br>The focus of this project is more on the Databases side, as it was created purely for the Databases class at <b>Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering Iași</b>.
<br>
<br>
<b>Key concepts learned:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Using <b>Flask</b> to make small web apps: routes, sessions, requests, etc;
  <li>Working with <b>Python</b>: lists, dictionaries, datetime, hashing passwords with b_crypt, connecting to external database, working with environment values, etc;
  <li><b>git</b>: gitignore, filtering languages that appear on the github language tab 
  <li>Projecting databases and working with them: <b>Oracle SQL, SQL Developer, Oracle Data Modeler, python cx_oracle</b>;
  <li>General and key Web Develompent concepts, as well as HTML forms and general syntax + CSS;
  <li>Writing documentation in <b>LaTeX</b>
  <li>Using <b>Docker</b> for containerization

More details about the application can be found in the <b>documentation</b>(.pdf), but only in the <b>Romanian language</b>.
